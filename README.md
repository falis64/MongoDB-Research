# What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It allows for scalability, flexibility, and performance, making it a popular choice for modern web applications

# What are NoSQL databases?

NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that don't use SQL as their primary language for querying data. Unlike SQL databases, they don't rely on fixed table schemas, and they often use distributed architectures that can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

# How do they differ from SQL?

SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational.

SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.

SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

# Why is MongoDB popular? What is itâ€™s history?

MongoDB is popular because of its scalability, flexibility, and performance. It can handle large amounts of unstructured data and is well-suited for modern web applications that require fast and easy data access. It has also become popular because it makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and retrieve data when creating applications with most programming languages.

MongoDB came around to provide a solution To provide a solution for the problems of scalability and agility that they were facing at DoubleClick.

# What is seeding in MongoDB? Why do Mongo databases need to be seeded?

Seeding in MongoDB involves populating a database with initial data to provide a starting point for the application. This is often done during development to ensure that the application has data to work with. Seeding can also be used to create test data for the application.

# What port does MongoDB use?

MongoDB uses port 27017 as its default port for client connections
